We've all been asked the question "What type of music do you listen to?".  Are in the "a little bit of everything" camp, or do you feel you have more specific tastes.   The analysis below is a quantitative approach to answering this question.  Leveraging data - 9 features for songs in my library - sourced through Spotifyâ€™s API, I will see if there are distinct clusters in the music I frequently listen.  These clusters can be interpreted to represent different genres, moods, or other commonalities among the songs grouped together.

While this is fun to dig into on a personal level, there are parallels with how this can be applied in a business perspective as well.  For example, while this analysis is on an individual-level of 1 user, a similar segmentation analysis could be done on a more macro-scale, analyzing the music saved by an entire customer base.  A cluster in that case would represent a group of customers that listen to a specific type or types of music.  Custom strategies can then be tailored to individual groups, such as targeted marketing announcing the launch of new artists or albums that fit the tastes of specific groups of customers.
